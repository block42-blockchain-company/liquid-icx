LICX is IRC-2 token standard implementation, where 1 LICX represents 1 ICX staked in pool.
Main goal of LICX implementation is to be able to transfer assets, while still getting staking rewards.
As stated above the ratio between LICX and ICX will always stay 1:1. LICX is achieving that by air-dropping rewards each prep-term.
While air-dropping could have downsides,


IRC-2 functions
LICX implements all the standard IRC-2 methods.
- name
- symbol
- decimals
- totalSupply
- balanceOf
- transfer

To participate at the pool/protokol, they also some other methods implemented.
- Join
Adds a join (mint) request to the wallet, which converts ICX to LICX. Joining requests are resolved once per term in distribute function,
which is described bellow. Each wallet has maximal of 10 join requests per term. LICX tokens are locked for 2 terms, since they are not producing any rewards yet.

- Leave
Adds a leave (burn) request to the wallet, which converts LICX to ICX. Similar to the joining requests, also leave requests are resolved
once per term only.

- Distribute
Does not only distribute rewards to the all the wallets involved in protocol, but also resolves each wallets join/leave requests.
